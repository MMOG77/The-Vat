## Writing Habit Audit Revisited

As I mentioned in the previous exercise (near the beginning of the semester), I like to write outlines for my work and flesh out the content section-by-section. I am more likely to get a headstart on assignments that require (read: *allow*) creativity. If a project requires me to only report the facts, I am more likely to put it off; papers that do not require creative problem-solving do not inspire me as much as papers that allow for splashes of personality and wit. Creative writing is challenging *and* fun. More scientific writing is like eating a tough, dry piece of food&mdash;a challenge without the intrinsic reward of enjoyability. I will usually give myself 3-4 sittings for a creative piece and 1-2 for a more scientific piece.

- **One improvement:** I need to take more initiative on writing projects that I do not find exciting.
- **One strength:** I have a unique narrative voice. Often, I will find effective but unusual wording for common concepts. This literary fingerprint prevents my writing pieces from being forgettable.
