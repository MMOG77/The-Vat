## Writing Habit Audit Revisited

As I mentioned in the previous exercise (near the beginning of the semester), I like to write outlines for my work and flesh out the content section-by-section. I am more likely to get a headstart on assignments that require (read: *allow*) creativity. If a project requires me to only report the facts, I am more likely to put it off; papers that do not require creative problem-solving do not inspire me as much as papers that allow for splashes of personality and wit.
