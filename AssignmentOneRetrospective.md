# Assignment One Retrospective

Honestly, this first project stressed me out. Since I had taken an XHTML class in eight grade, the formatting for Markdown was not too much of a hurdle; however, the thought of the first assignment being worth 1/5 of the final grade gave me anxiety in the week leading up to the due date.

My main issue was with complexity. This assignment made me realize how little I know in terms of skills. Self-publishing is the closest thing to a technical skill that I have, and even then, I had to re-learn parts of the process because the platform had changed since I last used it. Meeting the word count was not much of a problem; my internship as an SEO content writer prepared me to fill a word quota. 
The process of preparing and inserting images was fun but time-consuming.
