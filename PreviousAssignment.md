# Confounding the Saint with the Rogue: Emerson’s “Self-Reliance” Through the Lens of Scriptural Principles

----

Ralph Waldo Emerson, throughout the essay “Self-Reliance,” uses bold rhetoric to awaken the same boldness in his audience. Although Emerson’s advocation for bravery and proactivity is commendable, the egocentrism, superiority complex, willful forgetfulness, and inconsistency that he promotes contradict the camaraderie, selflessness, lifestyle of remembrance, and faithfulness that scripture encourages.

A founding father of Transcendentalism, Emerson “shared a key belief [of the philosophy] that each individual could transcend, or move beyond, the physical world of the senses into a deeper spiritual experience through free will and intuition” (Biography). Transcendentalism has its roots in the Unitarian Church, a non-messianic offshoot of English Protestantism; not surprisingly, many facets of this philosophy border on theology without ever entering the realm of religious doctrine (Transcendentalism).

The most accessible aspects of Transcendentalism come from the areas in which the worldview overlaps with Protestant Christianity—and even secularism—regarding assertive self-esteem. These principles can result in domestic and civil unrest when put into practical application, though.
Like any religion (or, in this case, borderline religious philosophy), Transcendentalism is convenient to profess, but more difficult to put into practice. Historian Wesley T. Mott addresses this discrepancy:

> Usually, invoking Emerson proves harmless. Quoting the Sage of Concord on the beauty of a snowstorm or a forest is innocuous enough. But the matter becomes stickier when we invoke him to endorse political or social agendas . . . . In the American experience, perhaps no abstract terms are more emotionally or ideologically charged than self-reliance and individualism, terms whose currency is generally credited to Emerson. (Mott 62)

At a passing glance, the importance of the term self-reliance is evident due to its status as the title of Emerson’s classic essay; however, the topic of individualism rises to the surface of the text upon further analysis.
In all fairness to Emerson, the bravado that he espouses in “Self-Reliance” is not out of place in the canon of Scripture. The entire Book of Joshua chronicles a nation’s account of fighting for their divinely-granted property rights (1.1-24.33). The modern equivalent of such conquest under the New Covenant is evangelism. Not all brave people travel, but no coward will “go and make disciples of all nations” (Matthew 28.19). The maverick nature that Emerson encourages draws inspiration from the Bible while simultaneously contradicting the holy book. Like Paul writing his epistle to the Romans, Emerson calls for nonconformity to the status quo of mainstream society (Life in the Spirit Study Bible, Romans 12.2; Emerson 271).

The author of self-reliance, however, proposes an egocentric solution to the problem of an untrustworthy society. Emerson proposes navel-gazing as the purest method of truth discovery: “Trust thyself: every heart vibrates to that iron string” (270). His philosophy hinges on the reliability of the human heart, specifically the individual’s heart whose willpower society has not diluted. In fact, Emerson speaks of his internal consciousness as if it were his deity: “I shun father and mother and wife and brother, when my genius calls me” (272). His words borrow heavily from one of Jesus Christ’s early sermons: “Anyone who loves his father or mother more than me is not worthy of me” (Mathew 10.37).
  
The Old and New Testaments of the Bible speak in tandem to reveal universal truths (2 Timothy 3.16). In the biblical Book of Jeremiah, the titular prophet accuses the human heart of being “deceitful above all things and beyond cure” (17.9). Here, Jeremiah denounces the credibility of individual intuition, a denunciation like that of Paul toward popular opinion. The divinely-inspired authors of the Bible balance their skepticism of the masses with a healthy doubt of their own right-headedness.

Emerson’s worldview (at least as represented in “Self-Reliance”) demonstrates a wariness for the world and a simultaneous exaltation of the rugged individual. Such logic leads to a superiority complex. Exalting infants as role models for adults, Emerson writes, “Infancy conforms to nobody: all conform to it” (270). Again, his words indirectly invoke Christ: “Truly I tell you, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of heaven like a little child will never enter it” (Mark 10.15). In both contexts, the speaker praises children’s “mind being whole”—the unchecked willfulness of their earliest years (Emerson 270). The Transcendentalist, however, lauds childlike boldness as a means to receive others’ servitude; the Nazarene uses the same boldness to exemplify the attitude necessary to approach the Heavenly Father. Also unlike “Self-Reliance,” the heroes of the Bible exemplify the bravery to venture into other geographic locations.

Immediately after his “iron string” comment, Emerson references a type of spirituality concerning one’s station in life. He instructs his audience, “Accept the place where divine Providence has found you” (Ibid). He then reemphasizes his stance (so to speak) on rootedness, stating, “It is for want of self-culture that the idol of Travelling, the idol of Italy, of England, of Egypt, remains for all educated Americans” (Emerson 283). The author’s use of the word idol to describe other nations asserts that one’s homeland, or even one’s personal abode, deserves reverence as a god. The saints described in the biblical Book of Hebrews beg to differ. The author of Hebrews catalogues several heroes of the faith in chapter eleven, and many of those heroes lived nomadic lifestyles. “If they had been thinking of the country they had left,” the author writes, “the would have had opportunity to return. Instead, they were longing for a better country—a heavenly one.” (11.15-16). The word heavenly carries most of the meaning in this sentence; it acts as the rhetorical capstone. This earth, in its fallen state, does not merit veneration as anything more than a piece of property of which humans are tenants (Genesis 9.1-3). No change in location will satisfy one’s longing for Heaven. The world’s true, eternal treasures are the souls of the people who inhabit it.

The Old Covenant, which Jehovah made with Moses, no longer holds the same authority as when Jesus had not come (Romans 7.1-6). In the Book of Luke, however, Jesus affirms the Israelites’ Levitical law to love one’s neighbor as oneself (Luke 10.27). Keep in mind that the term neighbor does not necessarily limit one’s focus to his or her region. Sometimes a parson needs to travel for miles before reaching the neighbor to whom God has commanded the endowment of one’s kindness. Of course, Emerson does address the topic of philanthropy—in a manner condescending toward his hypothetical beneficiaries. Based on Emerson’s tone, a Transcendentalist scholar has reasonable warrant to infer that Americans of that time sought in foreign lands what their souls lacked. Instead, the so-called “Sage of Concord” creates a rhetorical sketch of the ideal, self-actualized traveler, who “visits cities and men like a sovereign, and not like an interloper or a valet” (Mott 62; Emerson 283).

In parts of “Self-Reliance,” Emerson appears to advocate for willful forgetfulness, outright denying consistency as a desirable trait at one point: “A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds” (274). The Transcendentalist patriarch calls into question the usefulness of the past for providing lessons to those who should pursue self-knowledge. The saints in the Bible, authors and protagonists both, demonstrate encyclopedic knowledge of their history—especially in relation to the faithfulness of Jehovah. Even in the New Testament, as the central figures of the biblical narrative strive to establish a new model for the Church under the New Covenant, Saint Stephen recites a condensed version of the Old Testament to show the connections between past and present, thereby illustrating the consistency of God’s character (Acts 7.1-53).

Though noble in his attempt to stoke courage within his audience, Emerson speaks through the text of “Self-Reliance,” Emerson. He overemphasizes the spark of divinity within mankind while contradicting the words of the Divine. The Sage of Concord does not perfectly align himself with biblical principles, but his work does parallel Christian dogma regarding the necessity of fortitude (Mott 62).
While “Self-Reliance” is not without merit, Emerson’s philosophy throughout the piece overlooks the virtues of camaraderie, remembrance, steadiness, and selflessness. Camaraderie with others safeguards the individual from his or her own shortcomings. A self-sacrificing nature allows others to reap the benefits of an individual’s growth. Remembrance makes adaptive improvement possible for one’s spirit. Faithfulness (consistency) grants others with an assurance of one’s trustworthiness. Instead of merely dressing rogues in saints’ clothing, these compounded virtues arm saints with a rogue’s undampened level of determination.
