## Group 1 (Autumn, Michaela, Matt)

***

1. Since Group 1 is the group in this class with both of the English majors, we agreed that most of Alley's instructions are composition principles that we have learned in other writing-heavy classes. Michaela and Autumn enjoyed the concision chapter. Matt enjoyed the instructions chapter in which we learned the importance of illustrations to instruction.

2. Uses of writing/composition in the workplace &mdash; **Autumn:** Taking orders from customers **Michaela:** Blogging **Matt:** Creating syllabi

3. Resumes

4. Final assignment suggestion: **Technical Napping**
