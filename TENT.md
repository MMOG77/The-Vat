## Tent
On the 4th of July, I used instructions to assemble a picnic tent to provide shade. My experience was a pleasant surprise. The instructions included a sketch of the tent's skeleton with every piece identified. The physical pieces of the tent skeleton each had a label corresponding with its name in the booklet. By comparing my work with a sketch of the finished product and by identifying each piece according to its label, I constructed the tent.
