**Statement:** Foragers should be aware that some wild mushrooms are toxic.

**Analogy:** Many files on the Internet&mdash;such as music and videos&mdash;are available free of charge if the user knows where to look.

Mushrooms, for example, can be valuable sustenance or a cause of food poisoning. Toxins in food, like viruses in digital files, are a pitfall for the undiscerning forager.
