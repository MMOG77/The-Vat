## Matt's Paper-Writing Process
My process for writing a paper during the semester&mdash;or ad content for my summer internship&mdash;begins with a loose outline. I use hyphens for my main points, carrots for secondary points, forward slashes for third-tier points, and periods for minor points. (I devised the system in grade school, likely before I knew about official outline formatting.) I usually begin with one- or two-word points. Then I expand each point into a full sentence. I continue to add information to each term until every secondary point is its own paragraph. Usually, the main points coincide with a portion of my thesis statement, and I delete them once the paragraphs have sufficient content.
