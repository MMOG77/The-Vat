# Self-Publishing E-Books with Kindle Direct Publishing
*****
## Introduction
If you’ve been sitting on a manuscript that has yet to see the light of day, allow the Internet’s favorite  bookstore-turned-online-supermarket to give you a hand. Anyone with an Amazon account can now access Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP). As you will soon see, self-publishing is the process by which a formatted text document can become an electronic book on the digital market! (If you are not already on Amazon, take a minute to register by [entering some basic information](https://www.amazon.com/ap/register?openid.pape.max_auth_age=0&openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fyourstore%2Fhome%3Fie%3DUTF8%26action%3Dsign-out%26path%3D%252Fgp%252Fyourstore%252Fhome%26ref_%3Dnav_youraccount_signout%26signIn%3D1%26useRedirectOnSuccess%3D1&prevRID=KYVS0T5VM096M8BXSJEG&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=usflex&openid.mode=checkid_setup&openid.ns.pape=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fextensions%2Fpape%2F1.0&prepopulatedLoginId=&failedSignInCount=0&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&pageId=usflex&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0). Aspiring authors who already have some degree of notoriety should consider using their work e-mail, leveraging their accounts as side businesses.)

No two authors bring the same plans to the table. Whether your goal is to thrill readers with the world’s next great beach read or galvanize the people to action with a political treatise, Amazon has you covered. This tutorial will consist of helpful screencaps of the various stages of self-publishing combined with tips for optimizing your self-publishing experience. I may not have invented self-publishing or created the Kindle Direct Publishing system, but I’ve been around this block, and I can give first-timers an idea of what to expect. Your document is not going to put *itself* on the market, so let’s begin the process of self-publishing through KDP.

## 1: Visiting [KDP.Amazon.com](https://kdp.amazon.com/en_US?ref_=TN_si)

![KDP Homepage](https://github.com/MMOG77/The-Vat/blob/master/KDPsc1.png)

At this point, feel free to open another tab and walk through the process as you learn. For every step, turn your knowledge into action with an immediate application. Then, your dream of publishing that manuscript will no longer be a distant aspiration; in fact, your level of progress may take you by surprise.

Sign in with the same credentials that you would use for regular Amazon shopping. Once logged in, you will find yourself at the bookshelf, your personal control panel. I have two previous projects on mine, as you can see from the screencap below. For the tutorial’s sake, I will begin a new project from scratch. Notice the blue plus signs above my previous projects.

KDP offers two publication paths: electronic books and paperbacks (see FAQ below). We will tackle paperback publishing&mdash;the more involved of the two processes&mdash;first. Click the top plus sign, and we will proceed to stage two.

## 2. Entering Publication Information

Think of this next step as filling out an application for your book. To help place your work in the global market, identify the text’s language (red) with a pull-down menu. Next, enter your piece’s *name*: its title and possibly a subtitle (blue).
![Language, Title, Subtitle](https://github.com/MMOG77/The-Vat/blob/master/KDPsc3.1.png)

Most readers consume books of all genres in a serialized format. If your piece is part of a larger series, be sure to enter the name of the series and the number one to classify it as the first entry (green). Authors who plan on revising a book can update content and re-release it as a new edition (orange). Then enter your name or pseudonym (black), followed by the names of any collaboration partners (gray).
![Series Info, Edition, Author, Collaborators](https://github.com/MMOG77/The-Vat/blob/master/KDPsc3.2.png)

Offer an electronic blurb about the book (purple). In the section immediately following, you can designate to KDP whether you want to retain a copyright or release a work into the public domain (gold). Be careful, though. [KDP only allows users to publish public domain content that they own or public domain content to which they have made a unique contribution.](https://kdp.amazon.com/en_US/help/topic/G200743940) If you’re looking to republish a classic without any alterations, forget about it.
![Description, Domain](https://github.com/MMOG77/The-Vat/blob/master/KDPsc3.3.png)

As insignificant as keywords (slate blue) and categories (pink) may seem, they are a part of the [SEO (Search Engine Optimization)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF515-0Tduk) process. The digital tags with which you earmark your book will allow potential readers to find it more easily. Trying to reach a specific audience? A well-labeled product in the digital age can perform some of the heavy lifting *for* you!
![Keywords, Category](https://github.com/MMOG77/The-Vat/blob/master/KDPsc3.4.png)

Hold on; we’re almost to the fun part. Age and Grade ratings allow you to narrow down your audience according to maturity level (red, dotted). Finally, the last section of this stage (blue, dotted) allows authors the option of giving their book a delayed release and opening a pre-order campaign.

## 3. Entering Content

This is the moment we've been waiting for. This stage is the point at which your words achieve Internet immortality! Just be sure to check out the official [list of supported file types](https://kdp.amazon.com/en_US/help/topic/G200634390) before uploading.

![Upload a text file](https://github.com/MMOG77/The-Vat/blob/master/KDPsc4.1.png)

KDP offers two options for cover design. Authors with graphic arts skills can prepare a JPG or TIFF image to upload directly to the site. If your talent for visual arts is lacking, don't worry. KDP's Cover Creator software&mdash;a program similar to Microsoft PowerPoint&mdash;allows you to craft images from either a wallpaper background or a stock photograph. (If Amazon's stock photo library does not have the right picture for you, consider perusing [ShutterStock](https://www.shutterstock.com/?kw=shutterstock&gclid=Cj0KCQjw3KzdBRDWARIsAIJ8TMTytxEi4At5jpzx2xnRF0ixoQwQm-PB_CflZLAcD1nRJNmJR43GuLwaAr5qEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds&dclid=CNLo9vO-2d0CFU11AQodOOkIyg) or [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) to find the perfect fit for your content.)

## 4. Entering Marketing Information

At this point in the process, Amazon will try to convince you to enroll your book in several rewards programs. For now, let's keep it simple. Select a royalty plan (green, dotted)&mdash;35% for e-books under $2.99, or 70% for e-books $2.99 and above. Name your price (orange, dotted) in the currency of your bank account, and voila\u{o}!

**Before you go forth and take the literary world by storm, let's lay those burning questions to rest.**

## **FAQ**
>**Q:** Can I only publish electronic books through KDP?
>
>**A:** Kindle Direct Publishing distributes both paperbacks and e-books. True, KDP used to be a platform only for electronic books, and Amazon’s CreateSpace site was the platform for paperbacks, but now KDP handles both. Amazon is now directing many authors who started on CreateSpace to transfer their content to KDP.
*****
>**Q:** Can I *also* upload recordings through KDP to create audiobooks?
>
>**A:** No. Amazon has a separate self-publishing platform for audiobooks: [Audiobook Creation Exchange](https://www.amazon.com/gp/education-publishing/Audiobooks?ref=edupub_hm_wp_ab) (ACX).
*****
>**Q:** What about the bottom line? How much profit will I make per book?
>
>**A:** Your profit margin depends both on the medium of publication and on your choice of price.
*****
>**Q:** How do I receive royalties?
>
>**A:** As part of your user profile, Amazon will ask for your bank account number and routing number to set up convenient direct deposits.

Now that you've armed yourself with knowledge, it's time to **start** the presses!
